# Titanic Classification ðŸ›³

We conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset and preprocessed the data. 

We implemented four classification algorithms:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Artificial Neural Network
3. Decision Tree
4. Logistic Regression

By implementing these algorithms, we analyzed which algorithm works best with this dataset.
